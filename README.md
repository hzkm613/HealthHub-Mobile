‚ö° **Challenges & Solutions:**

- **Challenge:** I had never used **MAUI** before, and compared to other mobile development frameworks, it lacked flexibility and had limited resources available online
    - **Solution:** I quickly adapted by thoroughly researching official documentation, following tutorials, and experimenting with small projects. Since I couldn't always find direct answers, I **learned how to troubleshoot issues independently** and adapt solutions from similar technologies. This experience not only helped me master **MAUI** but also strengthened my ability to **learn new frameworks efficiently and problem-solve with limited resources**
- **Challenge:** MAUI‚Äôs limitations affected some of the initial UI design ideas, requiring adjustments to maintain a **clean and intuitive** user experience
    - **Solution:** I analyzed MAUI‚Äôs constraints and **redesigned certain UI elements** to work within its capabilities while still ensuring clarity and ease of use. I focused on a **simple, structured layout with clear visual hierarchy**, ensuring users could quickly understand service statuses without confusion. This experience taught me how to **balance design vision with technical feasibility** and make **practical compromises when necessary**
- **Challenge:** Ensuring a **clean and intuitive UI** so that users could quickly understand the service status and navigate the app with ease
    - **Solution:** I focused on **simplicity and clarity in UI design**, using **minimalist layouts, clear visual hierarchy, and intuitive icons**. I refined the design based on user feedback, ensuring that critical information was easy to find without overwhelming the user
